
I can feel the orange of warmth from this sunset
I'm walking on a tightrope
My nose is being stabbed
I
your a needle in a haystack execpt i can spot you from space
You're like david vs goliath. like wow you're brave
Wow this is small even for beggars
I'm like a dog seeing his owner after the vet
wow they didn't have thier coffee this morning
call me el chapo because nothing is stopping me
and I thought a library was a quiet place
needles are coming out of my chest
I've got the lower class amount
angels had their grace today
someone call god becauase they are smarter than an asian
bob ross would need a tutorial to paint this beatifuly
I'm a cocaine addict and I have run out of cocaine
10 of cats are ready to pounce
slaves wouldn't even be willing to do this
we are at disney land except its a back alley
I'm Neveah when she doesn't have her nicotine
we would go out to eat just to put food in her mouth
