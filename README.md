This app was originally designed to help use certain chapters in a book to learn about being more silly
in day to day conversation. Each chapter taught something different and then it would use a simple
game based off that chapter to truly practice what the chapter was talking about.

I made this in 2024 and forgot about it, so if you want a feel for what it intails i would just
go into the games tab from the menu and just try some of the games.
